 * 1. Horses and Riders
 * 
 * A family walks past a riding stable on their Sunday walk. While the children watch the horses, the father counts diligently and proudly announces: "I  * * counted 8 heads and 20 legs. How many horses and riders are on the farm?"
 * 
 * Solve the puzzle with a Prolog program using the Peano numbers from the lecture. Define a predicate rider that relates the number of heads and legs to  * the number of horses and riders.
